# MACHANGEL EYES
Machangel Eyes is a website that can tell you the estimated arrival of the bus you want to board in.
It will show you time estimated time arrival based on different levels: "reaching!", "yellow, x mins", "red, x mins"

The thing about MACHANGEL EYES is that it gives more information about your bus arrival time. Such as, what you can do with the time you have until your bus reaches and a more attractive interface compared to the ones available on the market. 


## Design Process
This is for people who take public transport and wants to know when thei bus is arriving or if the train disrupted. This is extremely essential for this people as they will be able to know about their request and see if they need to make any adjustments to their journey.
it is also for people who drive cars and wants to check the estimated travel times on the expressways. They can also make adjustments to their journey accordingly. 

As a user type, I want to use the PPNC (Estimated Time Number Cruncher) so that I can raftly estimate when my bus will arrive at the point of time.
As a user type, I want to use the MRT is disrupted feature to see if there are any MRT disrupted at the point in time.

## Features 
- Allows users to check estimated arrival time of the bus
- Using the estimated time to suggest things they can do 
- Allows users to see Weather 
- Allows users to check traffic conditions 
- Allows users to use a cool feature where they can see live road images.

## Technologies used 
- Jquery to simplify DOM manipulation
- Google fonts

## Features to implement in the future
- Shows if there is any MRT disrupted
- Shows estimated travel time on expressways
Features to implement in the future 
- taxi availabity when MRT is disrupted
Hence, Machangel Eyes is like an all in one package.
