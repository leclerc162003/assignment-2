MACHANGEL EYES
Machangel Eyes is a website that can tell you the estimated amount of people that would be in the train station that you want to be at.
It will tell you the volume of the potential passengers based on low, moderate, high. It will also give you a raft estimate value of passengers there. 
The thing about MACHANGEL EYES is that it does not use real time data. It uses the data from the past three months and caluclate the average passenger volume to come up with the potential passengers. It might not be 100% accurate but the numbers will not be absurdly far off. In addition, this also allow passengers to plan their trip prior to the actual date. So that they can raftly gauge when they should start their journey or whether to opt to take another form of transport.

Design Process
This is for people who take public transport and wants to know how crowded the station is. This is extremely essential in this current situation where some people may want to avoid crowded places as to protect themselves from potential carriers of covid-19. 

As a user type, I want to use the PPNC (Potential Passengers Number Cruncher) so that I can raftly estimate how crowded a particluar MRT Station is at the point of time.

Features 
- Allows users to check potential passangers on the same MRT journey as them by using this faeature
- Using the numbers caluclated to tell the user whether to take a taxi and show estimated travel times

Features to implement in the future 
- taxi availabity 

Testing
